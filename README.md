# ArcEager

In this project, we perform neural dependency parsing using the [ArcEager](https://aclanthology.org/C12-1059/) model with both Bi-LSTM and BERT as oracles.

## Contents

* Arc-Eager: Parser and static oracle

* Dataset: Analysis and preprocessing

* Baseline Model: Bi-LSTM (from scratch)

* BERT-based model (from scratch)

* Error analysis

* Discussion: Procedures, results, and comparison with SOTA
